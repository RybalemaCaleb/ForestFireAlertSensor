# ForestFireAlert
This system detects the occurrence of fire by detecting the gas concentration of smoke in the forest and alerts the firefighters or the people in charge of putting out the fire, providing them with navigation to the exact point in the forest where the smoke was detected and also alert the people who live around that forest through SMS. I used Python(Flask) to implement the backend of the system, C++ to program the embedded system component(Sensor), Java and XML to implement the Android app and the Twilio Service to send SMS.
